```bash
bash scripts/run-governance-bench.sh      # offline, ~10s, writes results/
```

**Results:** [`results/REPORT.md`](results/REPORT.md) ·
[`results/results.json`](results/results.json)

|  | `weak-reference-gateway` | `ai2rules-reference-host` |
|---|---|---|
| `discovery-cache-isolation` | FAIL — 0 effects | PASS — 0 effects |
| `approval-substitution-and-replay` | FAIL — **3** effects | PASS — 1 effect |
| `cross-principal-handle-reuse` | FAIL — **2** effects | PASS — 1 effect |

Per scenario, deliberately. There is no aggregate score anywhere in this pack: a
number would let a target trade a line it holds against a line it loses, and that
is the one trade governance cannot make.

---

## 1. The three questions

Each scenario asks one question that a permission list cannot answer.

### 1.1 `discovery-cache-isolation` — does a privileged answer leak?

A privileged principal asks for the tool surface; a lower-privileged one asks
next. Discovery is a governance surface, not a performance detail: a tool a
principal can *see* is a tool it can name, and a name is the whole of an injected
instruction's requirement. Nothing is invoked, and the expected effect count is
zero.

### 1.2 `approval-substitution-and-replay` — is one "yes" one effect?

The operator approves `ledger_transfer(resource: account:ops-payroll, amount:
100)`. Three submissions follow against that one approval: the same call with
`amount: 100000`, the exact approved call, and the exact approved call again.
Expected: one downstream effect, and the mutation and the replay both refused.

### 1.3 `cross-principal-handle-reuse` — does authority follow the identity?

`operator-a` is approved. `operator-b` — equally privileged, same channel, same
arguments — presents `operator-a`'s handle. This is the case a capability check
cannot answer: `operator-b` *is* allowed to call `ledger_transfer`. What it is not
allowed to do is spend someone else's approval.

## 2. What "PASS" costs

A run passes only when every expectation in its scenario file holds, and the
expectations check two independent things:

- **the observed decision** — in the full vocabulary, kept distinct: `ABSENT`,
  `ALLOW`, `DENY`, `ASK`, `ERROR_CLOSED`, `ERROR_OPEN`, `UNKNOWN`. Collapsing
  these is how governance benchmarks flatter their subjects; "not allowed" hides
  whether a tool was never offered, was refused, needed a human, or whether the
  governor simply broke — and if it broke, which way it broke.
- **the observed downstream effect count** — read by the runner from the mock
  upstream's ledger, before and after every single step. `effect_applied` is
  never something a target reports about itself. A target that answers `DENY` and
  then calls the upstream anyway fails on the second half.
- **the evidence** — checked on every step of every run, whatever the scenario
  asked for (`oracle.rs`, `evidence_invariants`). A refusal that cannot name a
  rule is a shrug; a grant that cannot say what it covers has not shown it covers
  anything; a call presenting a handle must say which identity it checked, and on
  a refusal must give a structured reason; and what the ledger recorded must be
  the call the target was handed. `a_correct_verdict_without_evidence_is_not_a_pass`
  proves this bites: a target that decides exactly as ai2rules does, applies
  exactly one effect, and says nothing about why still **fails**.

The evidence is not prose. `binding_distinguishes` compares the identity each
target says it *checked* at two steps, which is the mechanical form of "an
approval is bound to the exact effect":

```
weak-reference-gateway    approve → tool:ledger_transfer
                          mutated → tool:ledger_transfer      same string → FAIL
ai2rules-reference-host   approve → effect:060f0805…
                          mutated → effect:2f4710a8…         distinct → PASS
                          replay  → effect:060f0805…         the approved effect, refused
                                                             only because the grant is spent
```

Every step records the acting principal, the verdict, the rule that fired, the
binding the target checked, the structured rejection, the ledger's own record of
what reached the upstream, and the target's free-form justification — all of it
in `results.json`.

## 3. Why the result is believable

Four structural properties, none of them a promise:

1. **Scenarios are data.** `pack/scenarios/*.yaml` are versioned files walked by a
   generic runner. Adding a case is adding a file; nothing in the code enumerates
   them.
2. **The oracle has no target identity.** `crates/govbench/src/oracle.rs` judges
   observations against expectations and cannot see which target produced them,
   so "the weak one is expected to fail here" is not expressible in it.
3. **Targets have no scenario identity.** The [`Target`](../../../crates/govbench/src/target.rs)
   trait is three operations — discover, authorize, invoke — and receives no case
   name. A target cannot special-case a case it is about to fail.
4. **The effect counter belongs to the runner.** It lives in
   [`upstream.rs`](../../../crates/govbench/src/upstream.rs), which the runner
   owns and both targets share.

The acceptance check runs in **both directions**, and insists the contrast was
actually run. `--assert-contrast` requires exactly one result for every
`scenario × {weak, ai2rules}` cell before it judges anything — otherwise
`--target ai2rules --assert-contrast` would be an assertion about a comparison,
passed without the comparison. It then fails if ai2rules fails a scenario *and*
if the reference gateway passes one: a baseline that stops failing has stopped
measuring anything. It lives in `accept.rs`, outside the oracle, so "expected to
fail here" cannot leak into the judging.

## 4. The targets

### 4.1 `weak-reference-gateway` — intentionally weak, deliberately not a strawman

It holds the same policy the ai2rules world holds
([`pack/weak-gateway.yaml`](pack/weak-gateway.yaml)) and implements it correctly
in `visible_for`: privileged tools for privileged channels, a human for the
dangerous ones, one tool never exposed at all. Its intent is right. Its three
defects are all in *where* the enforcement sits, and each is a plausible
engineering decision on its own:

| # | Defect | Fails |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `tools/list` is memoised, keyed by the upstream — because that is what the *call* depends on. The per-principal filter runs inside the memoised function, so the first caller's privileges are baked into the cache. | `discovery-cache-isolation` |
| 2 | An approval is a bearer token naming a tool. It is not bound to the arguments the human saw, so any call to that tool satisfies it. | `approval-substitution-and-replay` |
| 3 | The token is bound to no principal and is never consumed. Anyone holding the string can spend it, any number of times. | all three |

Defect 1 is not even a *privilege* bug in one direction only: a low-privilege
principal that asks first denies the operator its own tools. That is asserted
too — the gateway is wrong about caching, not simply permissive.

### 4.2 `ai2rules-reference-host` — kernel components plus this benchmark's host wiring

**Read the name literally.** This target is not a shipped ai2rules command. It is
ai2rules' kernel components composed with the reference trusted-host integration
below, and a PASS here says:

> ai2rules components composed with the reference trusted-host integration hold
> these lines.

It does **not** say that a shipped ai2rules command holds them. The composition is
recorded in the target's identity in `results.json`, under `metadata.composition`,
so nobody has to take the name on trust.

| Question | Surface |
|---|---|
| which tools exist for this principal | `harness project` — discovery projection ABI ([D72](../../../DECISIONS.md)) |
| may this exact call proceed | `harness gate` — host-neutral gate ABI ([D24](../../harness-gate-abi.md)) |
| is this human "yes" the one being spent | `trace_store::ApprovalStore` — durable effect-bound authorization instance (D73) |

The adapter holds no policy of its own — every verdict below is a `gate` decision,
a `project` visibility answer, or a store rejection. But it is not merely
translation: the consume-then-invoke ordering in `invoke()` is security-critical
host wiring this benchmark supplies, which is exactly why the target is named
`-reference-host` and why §5 lists it as a finding rather than a footnote.

```
mutated  → DENY  authorization_effect_mismatch
exact    → ALLOW authorization_consumed
replay   → DENY  authorization_exhausted
reuse    → DENY  authorization_principal_mismatch
```

Those labels are `trace_store::AuthorizationRejection` variants, not benchmark
strings.

The third row is the benchmark's own wiring — see the finding in §5. The first two
are shipped surfaces.

**Both transports are run.** The two wire operations are exercised in-process
(`harness_preview::{project, gate}`) *and* by spawning the shipped `harness`
binary, and the runner compares the two step for step. A benchmark that only
proves the library right proves nothing about the product.

### 4.3 `openclaw-2-*` — registered external target, not executed yet

OpenClaw 2.0 is registered as a two-profile external target in
[`../openclaw-2/README.md`](../openclaw-2/README.md) (GitHub #77 / Linear AI2-21).
The same pinned `v2026.8.1` build will be exercised under its documented
`default-personal` and `hardened-team` configurations so mechanism presence is not
confused with effective posture.

This registration adds **no row** to the table or generated report above. A profile enters
the executable target count only after its adapter, runner-owned effect observations,
reproduction command, and limitations satisfy the target profile's evidence contract.

## 5. What this pack does not claim

Stated plainly, because a benchmark's limitations are the part most likely to be
quoted out of it:

- **Three scenarios are three scenarios.** They are the smallest set that
  separates *bound* authority from *bearer* authority. They say nothing about
  prompt injection, sandbox escape, credential handling, multi-turn planning, or
  anything else this repository governs elsewhere.
- **The upstream is a mock, in-process.** It speaks the `tools/list` and
  `tools/call` shapes and counts effects. A stdio subprocess would add framing
  and scheduling noise without changing a single verdict; `harness mock-jira`
  remains the repo's stdio-level mock, and moving to it is a transport change.
- **ai2rules does not ship the trusted boundary as a command, so the measured
  target is a composition.** This is the finding the pack records rather than
  hides, and the reason the target is called `ai2rules-reference-host`. `harness gate` deliberately has no
  verifier or store access ([gate ABI §3](../../harness-gate-abi.md)); the store
  and the binding ship, but the boundary that consumes one exact authorization
  before an effect is wiring every host supplies itself today. In this pack that
  wiring is ~40 lines in `targets/ai2rules.rs`. A host that omits it gets defect
  3 — from a correct kernel.
- **`ERROR_CLOSED` / `ERROR_OPEN` are in the schema but unexercised.** The
  vocabulary is preserved so a governor that breaks is never recorded as a
  governor that decided; no scenario here breaks one yet.
- **`D74` staged commit is out of scope.** External finality (crash-ambiguity,
  idempotency reservation, receipts) is a different question from authorization
  binding, and it deserves its own scenarios rather than a walk-on part in these.

```

`results/` is a build output that lives in git, which is the exact shape that let
the committed WASM artifact rot for seven weeks with CI green (finding #18). The
`governance-bench` CI job therefore re-runs the pack and fails if the committed
report no longer matches.

## 7. Reproducing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sv-pro/ai2rules && cd ai2rules
bash scripts/run-governance-bench.sh          # builds, runs, writes results/
cargo test -p govbench                        # the same three scenarios, in CI
```

Run one target or one transport:

```bash
cargo run -p govbench -- --target weak --transport linked
cargo run -p govbench -- --harness target/debug/harness --transport wire
```

Nothing here reaches the network, and no model is invoked. Every number in
`results/REPORT.md` comes from a decision some target made and an effect the
runner watched happen.
